To start my assignment I  began by preparing the Project in netbeans.
I created my classes and named them Server.java, Client,java as well as Drone1&2.java
Today I have managed to prepare the basics of the server.
In my code I have implemented a server that listens for incoming client connections on port 8080.
I have also spent time trying to get things right with the clienthandler object. 

(Server.Java)

import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;

public class Server {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        
        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8080);
        System.out.println("Server started on port 8080");

        while (true) {
            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
            Thread thread = new Thread(new ClientHandler(clientSocket));
            thread.start();
        }
        
    }
    
    static class ClientHandler implements Runnable {
        
        private Socket clientSocket;
        
        public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {
            this.clientSocket = socket;
        }
        
        @Override
        public void run() {
            // handle client request here
        }
    }
}







I have spent the last couple days tryign to get my code correct for the client class.
I have setup the basics for my client class.
I decalred the necessary variables, as well setup message and response. I have also implemented the handle exceptions.

public class Client {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String serverHostname = "localhost";
        int serverPort = 8080; 
        try (Socket socket = new Socket(serverHostname, serverPort);
             BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
             PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), true)) {

            // Send a request to server
            String request = "Hello, server!";
            output.println(request);

            // Wait for response from server
            String response = input.readLine();
            System.out.println("Server response: " + response);

        } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
            System.err.println("Unknown host: " + serverHostname);
            System.exit(1);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.err.println("I/O error occurred when connecting to the server " + serverHostname);
            System.exit(1);
        }
    }
}
