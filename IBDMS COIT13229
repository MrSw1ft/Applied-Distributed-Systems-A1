To start my assignment I  began by preparing the Project in netbeans.
I created my classes and named them Server.java, Client,java as well as Drone1&2.java
Today I have managed to prepare the basics of the server.
In my code I have implemented a server that listens for incoming client connections on port 8080.
I have also spent time trying to get things right with the clienthandler object. 

(Server.Java) 

//Name:Roland Swift

import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;

public class Server {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        
        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8080);
        System.out.println("Server started on port 8080");

        while (true) {
            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
            Thread thread = new Thread(new ClientHandler(clientSocket));
            thread.start();
        }
        
    }
    
    static class ClientHandler implements Runnable {
        
        private Socket clientSocket;
        
        public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {
            this.clientSocket = socket;
        }
        
        @Override
        public void run() {
            // handle client request here
        }
    }
}









I have now been working on additional code for my server setup. By using a thread per connection model. 
It allows multiple drone requests to be executed simultaneously.
The server side receives drone requests, processes them, and returns results using the BufferedReader and PrintWriter classes for input and output operations.
The basic read and write operations needed to communicate between the client and server.
        
        
        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
                PrintWriter output = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true);

                while (true) {
                    // receive message from drone
                    String droneRequest = input.readLine();

                    // process request
                    String result = processDroneRequest(droneRequest);

                    // send response back to drone
                    output.println(result);
                }

            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.err.println("I/O error occurred when communicating with the drone");
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }

    public static String processDroneRequest(String request) {
        // process drone request here and return result
        return "Request processed: " + request;
    }
}
