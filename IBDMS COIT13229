To start my assignment I  began by preparing the Project in netbeans.
I created my classes and named them Server.java, Client,java as well as Drone1&2.java
Today I have managed to prepare the basics of the server.
In my code I have implemented a server that listens for incoming client connections on port 8080.
I have also spent time trying to get things right with the clienthandler object. 

(Server.Java)

import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.Socket;

public class Server {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        
        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(8080);
        System.out.println("Server started on port 8080");

        while (true) {
            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
            Thread thread = new Thread(new ClientHandler(clientSocket));
            thread.start();
        }
        
    }
    
    static class ClientHandler implements Runnable {
        
        private Socket clientSocket;
        
        public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {
            this.clientSocket = socket;
        }
        
        @Override
        public void run() {
            // handle client request here
        }
    }
}
